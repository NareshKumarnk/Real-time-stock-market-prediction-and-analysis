# Real-time-stock-market-prediction-and-analysis
Stock Market investors are in need of good quality stock prediction system to maximize their proﬁt and minimize their loss, this is why prediction systems getting more important. The Prediction system uses a deep learning based neural network system for prediction.  TensorFlow is used for designing the Deep Learning network where data that we web scrapped from the Yahoo finances with closing stock prices are predicted. Deep Learning oﬀers one of the best ways to predict stock market values using historical and time-series data.<br>

The project is done on Python 3 using Google TensorFlow Library for designing the Neural Network.Recurrent neutral network is used for prediction and dashboard is developed for analysis.

RNN models used:<br>
1.Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)</br>
2.Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM)</br>
3.Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)</br>
